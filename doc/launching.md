# launching

This piece of documentation looks at how flor execution are launched from Ruby code.

One can launch a flor execution from any SQL-able language by placing a well-formed `flor_messages` row within the database used by flor. See [below](#launching-manually).

Here is an example of execution "launching":
```ruby
msg =
  FLOR.launch(
    %q{
      concurrence     #
        alice _       # the "workflow definition",
        bob _         # the 'program' that flor interprets
    },
    domain: 'org.example',
    wait: true)
```

The flor instance is pointed at by a constant `FLOR` (like a project using [Sequel](https://sequel.jeremyevans.net) tends to point to its (usually) single database via the constant `DB`).

Here is another example of execution launching:
```ruby
data = { client: {} }
data[:client][:nick] = 'Taiwan Plastic'
# ...

msg =
  FLOR.launch(
    'iwm.asia.pfs.aws.onboarding',
    vars: { launcher: user.id },
    payload: data,
    wait: 'task; task', # wait until flow reaches first human task
    timeout: 14,
    on_timeout: 'shutup')
exid = msg['exid']
```
It sets initial variables, an non-empty initial payload and it's told to wait before returning until the execution has seen 2 "task" messages. This wait will timeout silently (shutup) after 14 seconds.

This launch happens in a layer of code just behind a controller. Hence the wait, it's supposed to block the `#launch` call until a workitem appears in the launchcher's group inbox.

The `#launch` options are:
* [domain:](#domain) - indicates which domain the execution will belong to
* [payload:](#payload--fields) - the initial payload
* [timeout:](#timeouts) - if a `wait:` is set, how long should it be waited for?
* [on_timeout:](#on_timeout) - in case of `timeout:`, what should happen when it triggers?
* [vars:](#vars) - the initial variable hash to use in the execution
* [wait:](#wait) - wait for certain events before allowing the `#launch` method to return
* [nolaunch:](#nolaunch) - doesn't actually launch, returns the launch message and the expanded launch options

## domain:

A string like `"org.example.accounting"` indicating which domain / subdomain the execution about to be launched should be belong to.

The domain choice has an impact how what taskers / subflows / variables / hooks the execution interacts with. See [domains.md](domains.md) for more information.

Defaults to the value set in the flor configuration or `""`.

## payload: / fields:

The initial payload / fields for the execution. Default to `{}`. Must be set to a Ruby hash that is JSON serializable. Symbol keys are OK, Ruby's JSON library turns them to string keys anyway.

Do not attempt to pass ActiveRecord model instances or things like that here, the JSON dumper would choke. Pass ids and let taskers fetch the data as they see fit.

## timeout:

Used in coordination with [wait:](#wait), how many seconds should the `#launch` hold before the requested wait pattern realizes?

[on_timeout:](#on_timeout) below determines what happens in case of timeout.

## on_timeout:

Currently accepts `"fail"` or `"shutup"`.

When `"fail"`, the timeout will provoke an error.

When `"shutup"`, the timeout doesn't provoke an error. The waited for message hasn't shown up, so instead, an object is returned which look like:
```ruby
{ 'exid' => "org.example.test-u0-20190305.2156.hekekefeba",
  'timed_out' => "shutup" }
```

Defaults to `"fail"`.

## vars:

The initial variables for the execution.

Follow the same "must be JSON serializable" command as given above for the initial payload / fields.

There is another way to set initial variables for an execution. That's via domain variables. See [domains.md](domains.md) for more information.

## wait:

Wait accepts `true`, a number, a string, or an array of strings.

When `wait: true`, the `#launch` call will return with the first `failed` or `terminated` message it sees. This is mostly used in flor's own specs.

When given a number, the number is turned to a timeout. For example, `wait: 7` is interpreted as `wait: true, timeout: 7`.

When given a string, that string is split by semi colons and turned into an array of strings.

When given an array of strings, the `#launch` will wait for each string to happen before returning (with the last match) or timing out.

* `wait: true` - is interpreted as `wait: 'failed,terminated'`
* `wait: 'task'` - wait for the first "task" message to happen (task delivered to tasker) and returns it
* `wait: '0_0 task'` - wait for the first "task" message to happen at node "0_0" and returns it
* `wait: '0_0 task,cancel'` - wait for the first "task" message to happen at node "0_0" and returns it
* `wait: '0_0 task|cancel'` - wait for the first "task" message or "cancel" message to happen at node 0_0
* `wait: 'task,cancel'` - wait for the first "task" or "cancel" message
* `wait: '0_0 task; 0_1 task'` - wait for a task reaching 0_0 and then for a task reaching 0_1
* `wait: [ '0_0 task', '0_1 task' ]` - same as right above
* `wait: '0_0 execute'` - wait for the execution to reach node 0_0
* `wait: '0_0 receive'` - wait for the first receive message handed to 0_0
* `wait: 'end'` - wait for an execution to pause (usually an execution runs for 77 messages before pausing and yielding for other executions to run, it might also "end" when sleeping or waiting for external messages)
* `wait: 'terminated'` - wait until the execution terminates (useful for testing or when using small flows without human participants)
* `wait: 'failed'` - wait until the execution emits a failed message (mostly useful when testing a flow)
* `wait: 'entered'` - wait until the execution enters a tagged branch
* `wait: 'left'` - wait until the execution leaves a tagged branch
* `wait: 'entered:stage-a'` - wait until the execution enters the branch tagged "stage-a"
* `wait: 'left:stage-b'` - wait until the execution leaves the branch tagged "stage-b"

Comma and pipe are interchangeable "or" operators within the wait strings.

Examples of the `#launch` and `wait:` combination can be seen in [spec/unit/waiter_launch_spec.rb](../spec/unit/waiter_launch_spec.rb). Examples of `wait:` arguments can be seen in [spec/unit/waiter_spec.rb](../spec/unit/waiter_spec.rb).

BUT, if you are launching from a flor unit/scheduler shared the database with another unit/scheduler instance, `#launch` and `#wait` only see message in their own unit.
SO you have to use a different, narrower, set of wait directives.

* `wait: 'tasker:alice'` - wait for a task to reach tasker alice, returns a Flor::Pointer instance (or times out)
* `wait: '0_0 tasker:alice'` - wait for a task to reach tasker alice at node 0_0, returns a Flor::Pointer instance (or times out)
* `wait: 'tag:stage-a'` - wait for the tag "stage-a" to be reached, returns a Flor::Pointer instance
* `wait: 'status:active'` - wait for the execution to be active, returns a Flor::Execution instance (or times out)
* `wait: 'status:terminated'` - wait for execution to be terminated
* `wait: 'var:customer_id'` - wait for the variable "customer_id" to be set at the root level, returns a Flor::Pointer instance (or times out)
* `wait: 'var:customer_id:123'` - wait for the variable "customer_id" to be set at the root level with the value 123 (string or integer), returns a Flor::Pointer instance (or times out)

See [multi_instance.md](multi_instance.md) for information and suggestions about such multi flor instance deployments. The spec [waiter_multi_spec.rb](../spec/unit/waiter_multi_spec.rb) explores a two instance setup, with one passive and one active flor instance.

## nolaunch:

When `nolaunch:` is given something trueish, the launch call won't actually launch, it'll just return the launch message and the expanded launch options.

It might be useful for debugging, but also to prepare template launch messages for [manual insertion](#launching-manually) in the database's flor_messages table.

## other wait techniques

TODO

## launching manually

(launching with a passive or active flor unit, simply by inserting a launch message in the `:flor_messages` table of the flor database)

### launching by inserting a message in the flor database
### launching by inserting a message in the spool/ directory

TODO

## waiting after launch

Waiting right after a launch is useful to give the launching user the impression of immediate progress (reaching the expecting stage in the execution) before handing her/him the hand back.

Likewise, it is necessary to wait also after completion of a task or emitting a (cancel or other) signal towards and execution.

```ruby
unit.wait(exid, 'tasker:bob')
  # block until the execution (exid) reaches tasker "bob"
```
