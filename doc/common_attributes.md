# common attributes

Attributes shared by all the procedures.


## vars:

Vanilla procedures don't have variables set at their level. The `vars` attribute sets a vanilla hash in the targeted procedure.


## vars: hash

Passing a hash (dictionary) of variables sets those variables at the local level for the node and its sub-nodes. Once the flow leaves the node, the variables previous values (or non-values) get visible again.

```
sequence
  set a 0
  # a is set to 0, b is unknown

  sequence vars: { a: 1, b: 1 }
    # a is set to 1, b is set to 1
    set a 2
    # a is set to 2, b is set to 1

  # a is set to 0, b is unknown
```


## vars: array

Passing an array whitelists the variables visible to a node and its sub-nodes.

```
sequence vars: { a: 'A', b: 'B' }
  # a is set to 'A', b to 'B'
  sequence vars: [ 'a' ]
    # a is set to 'A', b is unknown
```

Regular expressions may be used within such an array:
```
sequence vars: { a_0: 'a', a_1: 'A', a_z: 'z', b_0: 'b' }
  # a_0, a_1, a_z and b_0 are set
  sequence vars: [ /^a_\d+/ ]
    # only a_0 and a_1 are visible
```

If the first element of the array is "-", "^" or "!", the array is a blacklist. The var names explicitly listed are bound to nil values (shadowing the value in the parent node).

An array beginning with a "+" is a whitelist.

Please note that the blacklist/whitelist mechanisms work by setting local variables that shadow upstream variables. Maybe "screening" is a better term than "listing".


## vars: '*' or 'copy'

Copies all the currently visible variables locally.

```
sequence vars: { a: 'A', b: 'B' }

  a # yields 'A'

  sequence vars: '*'
    #
    # copies locally all the known vars at that point

    a # yields 'A'

    set a 'a'
    a # yields 'a'

  a # yields 'A'
```


## ret:

Sets the `payload: { ret: val }` (the return value).

It may be used to produce funny effects:
```
sequence
  1
  # f.ret is set to 1
  2 ret: 3
  # f.ret is set to 3
```


## tag: / tags:

Tags are a way to tag points in flows.

```
sequence
  sequence tag: 'first phase'
    concurrence tag: 'concurrent stage'
      alice _
      bob _
    charly tag: 'initial test stage'
  sequence tag: 'second phase'
    doug _
    eric _
```

The tag attribute sets one or more tags on a node. The tag can be used with the [cancel](procedures/cancel.md) procedure.

Read more on [tags](tags.md).

Read also about [sequence](procedures/sequence.md), it can implicitly enter into a tag:
```
  sequence 'second phase' # <-- equivalent to sequence tag: 'second phase'
    doug _
    eric _
```


## on_cancel:

When a branch gets cancelled, it has the opportunity to "react" after that cancellation.

```
define cancel_system
  remove_system _
  notify_admins 'new system cancelled'

sequence
  # ...
  sequence on_cancel: cancel_system
    prepare_system _
    notify_admins 'system ready'
  # ...
```

`on_cancel:` expects a function. An anonymous function definition might come in handy:
```
define cancel_system
  remove_system _
  notify_admins 'new system cancelled'

sequence
  # ...
  sequence on_cancel: (def \ remove_system _; notify_admins 'no new system')
    prepare_system _
    notify_admins 'system ready'
  # ...
```

Read also [on cancel](on_cancel.md).


## on_error:

The rescue/catch mechanism in flor. Given a node sporting the `on_error:` attribute, whenever an error occurs at that node or a sub-node level, the subtree gets cancelled and then, the function pointed at by `on_error:` gets executed.

```
set f.l []
sequence on_error: (def msg, err \ push f.l err.msg)
  push f.l 0
  push f.l x
  push f.l 1
```
An execution of this flow ends up with the field l containing `[ 0, "don't know how to apply \"x\"" ]` and the error is silenced.

The on_error attribute has a procedure counterpart [on_error](procedures/on_error.md) and the procedure [on](procedures/on.md) may also be used with the `error` symbol to wrap a on-error block.


## timeout:

A timeout may be set on any node.

```
sequence timeout: 60 # seconds
  alice 'perform task a'
  bob 'perform task b'
sequence
  charly 'perform task c' timeout: '2d12h' # two days and twelve hours
  david 'perform task d'
```

Alice and Bob have 60 to perform their tasks (they're probably automated) while Charly has 2 days and 12 hours. David has no time constraint.

When a timeout triggers, the subtree rooted in the node with the timeout: attribute gets cancelled

See "on_timeout:" below for calling a function when the timeout cancel completes.


## on_timeout:

One can point the on_timeout: attribute to a function that will be executed when the node times out.

```
sequence timeout: '3d' on_timeout: (def msg \ alice 'decommission tasks a and b')
  alice 'perform task a'
  bob 'perform task b'
```

TODO continue me (on_timeout and timeout at higher/lower levels)

Read more at [on_timeout](on_timeout.md).


## flank:

Explicitly flags a procedure as "flanking".

In this sample, the `a; b` sequence happens in parallel to the `c; d` parent sequence. As soon as `d` replies to its parent sequence, the flanking child will get cancelled.

```
sequence
  sequence flank
    a _
    b _
  c _
  d _
```


## disable: / off: / disabled: and disabled / off

When this attribute evaluates to something not false, it forces its node to stop and reply to its parent.

This sequence ends up having a set to 2:
```
sequence
  set a 0
  set a 1 off: false
  set a 2 off: true
  set a 3 disable: true
  set a 4 disabled: true
```

While this sequence has a set to 0:
```
sequence
  set a 0
  set a 1 off
  set a 2 disabled
```

Please note that the stopping of the node occurs right after the evaluation of the off/disable/disabled, not upon initial evaluation of the node. So
```
sequence
  set d true
  set a (+ 1 2 3) disable: d
```
will disable its `set a` but after the `(+ 1 2 3)` sum computation.

## child_on_error: / children_on_error:

It's nice to set `on_error:` on each child of a node, but it might get repetitive
```
sequence
  alpha on_error: (def \ _)
  bravo on_error: (def \ _)
  charly on_error: (def \ _)
```
or
```
define mute \ _
sequence
  alpha on_error: mute
  bravo on_error: mute
  charly on_error: mute
```
hence
```
sequence children_on_error: (def \ _)
#sequence child_on_error: (def \ _) # as you wish
  alpha
  bravo
  charly
```


## child_on_cancel: / children_on_cancel:

Similar to `child_on_error:`, sets the `on_cancel:` for each children instead.


## child_on_timeout: / children_on_timeout:

Similar to `child_on_error:`, sets the `on_timeout:` for each children instead.
