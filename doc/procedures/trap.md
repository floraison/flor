# trap

Watches the messages emitted in the execution and reacts when
a message matches certain criteria.

Once the trap is set (once the execution interprets its branch), it
will trigger for any matching message, unless the `count:` attribute
is set (it will trigger for the first {count} matching messages).

When the execution terminates, the trap is removed.

By default, the observation range is the execution, only messages
in the execution where the trap was set are considered.
The trap can be extended via the `range:` attribute.

"trap" triggers a function, while "on" triggers a block.

## the point: criterion

The simplest thing to trap is a 'point'. Here, the trap is set for
any message whose point is 'terminated':
```
sequence
  trap 'terminated'
    def msg \ trace "terminated(f:$(msg.from))"
  trace "here($(nid))"
    # OR
#sequence
#  trap 'terminated'
#    def msg \ trace "terminated(f:$(msg.from))"
#  trace "here($(nid))"
```

## the heap: criterion

Given a procedure like `sequence`, `concurrence` or `apply`, trigger
a piece of code each time the procedure receives the "execute" or the
"receive" message.

```
trap heap: 'sequence'
  def msg
    trace "$(msg.point)-$(msg.tree.0)-$(msg.nid)<-$(msg.from)"
sequence
  noret _
#
# will trace:
#  0:execute-sequence-0_1<-0
#  1:receive--0_1<-0_1_0
#  2:receive--0<-0_1
```

## the heat: criterion

While `heap:` filters on the actual flor procedure names, `heat:` is
looser, it catches whatever stands "at the beginning of the flor line".
It's useful to catch function calls.

```
trap heat: 'fun0'
  def msg
    trace "t-$(msg.tree.0)-$(msg.nid)"
define fun0
  trace "c-fun0-$(nid)"
sequence
  fun0 _
  fun0 # not a call

# will trace:
# 0:t-fun0-0_2_0
# 1:c-fun0-0_1_1_0_0-2
# 2:t--0_2_0
# 3:t--0_2_0
# 4:t-fun0-0_2_1
```

`heat:` accepts strings or regular expressions:

```
trap heat: [ /^fun\d+$/ 'funx' ]
  def msg \ trace "t-$(msg.tree.0)-$(msg.nid)"
```

## the tag: criterion

Traps one or multiple tags. Default to trapping on "entered". May trap
leaving tags with `point: 'left'` or any with
`point: [ 'entered', 'left' ]`.

```
trap tag: 'x'
  def msg
    trace "$(msg.tags.-1)-$(msg.point)"
# ...
sequence tag: 'x'
  trace 'c'

# will trace "x-entered" and "c"
```

## the signal: criterion

`signal:` traps signals directed at the execution. Signals are
directly
```
trap signal: 'S0'
  def msg
    trace "S0"
# ...
signal 'S0'
```

Note that it's OK to trap all signals, whatever their name, directed at
the execution by using `point: 'signal'`, as in:
```
trap point: 'signal'
  def msg
    trace "caught signal '$(sig)'"
```

[on](on.md) is a macro that turns
```
on 'rejected'
  trace "execution received signal $(sig)"
```
into
```
trap signal: 'rejected'
  def msg
    trace "execution received signal $(sig)"
```
Please note how "on" accepts a block while "trap" accepts a function.

## the range: limit

The range limit determines what is the range, or scope of the trap.
By default the trap only care about nodes below its parent. In other words,
the trap binds itself to its parent and observes the messages occurring
in the execution in the branch of nodes whose root is the parent.

The possible values for `range:` are:
* 'subnid' (default)
* 'execution'
* 'domain'
* 'subdomain'

With 'execution', the trap observes all the messages emitted within the
same execution.

With 'domain', all the messages in all the execution of the same domain are
observed. For example,
```
trap point: 'signal', domain: 'net.acme'
  def msg \ trace "signal '$(sig)' caught"
```
once set, will be triggered for each signal received by an execution in the
'net.acme' domain.

Likewise,
```
trap point: 'signal', subdomain: 'org.acme'
  def msg \ trace "signal '$(sig)' caught"
```
Will trap all signals in the domain "org.acme" and its subdomains,
(org.acme.accounting, org.acme.engineering, org.acme.whatever.x.y.z, ...)


## the bnid: directive

"bound nid" by default is the nid of the parent expression to the "trap".
With `bnid:`, one can bind a trap to another expression.


## the count: limit

```
trap tag: 'x' count: 2
  # ...
```
will trigger when the execution enters the tag 'x', but will trigger only
twice.


## the payload: directive

The `payload:` attribute tells the trap what payload to hand to the
trap handler.

When `payload: 'event'`, the handler is given a copy of the fields as
seen in the event that triggered the trap.

When `payload: 'trap'`, the handler is given a copy of the fields as
they were when and where the trap was set.

When `payload: { a: 'A' }`, the given payload is used (here
`{ 'a' => 'A' }`).


## blocking trap

One can use a trap without a function. It will block the execution branch
until the expect event, signal, etc occurs
```
sequence
  technical_writer 'prepare documentation'
  team_manager 'submit documentation to review team'
  trap signal: 'green' # go on after the 'green' signal...
  team_manager 'deploy documentation'
```
Here the execution will block after the team manager submits the doc
for review. When the 'green' signal comes, the flow resumes to 'deploy
documentation'.
